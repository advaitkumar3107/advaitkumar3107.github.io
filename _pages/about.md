I am a 4th year undergraduate student doing an Inter-Disciplinary Dual Degree Program (IDDDP) with a Bachelor’s in **Electrical Engineering** and a Master’s in **AI & Data Science** from IIT Bombay.

I am currently working on *Video Action Recognition using Generalised Zero Shot Learning* as part of my Bachelor's thesis under Prof. Biplab Banerjee. I am a part of the [Deep Learning in Remote Sensing & Computer Vision](https://biplab-banerjee.github.io) research group headed by him. I am also working on the research project, *Improving Generalisation for Automatic Data Augmentation in Reinforcement Learning*, under [Prof. Shivaram Kalayanakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/). Previously, I had worked under Prof. Biplab Banerjee on **Image Inpainting**, which culminated in the paper *RSINet: Inpainting Remotely Sensed Images Using Triple GAN Framework* where we proposed a new model that outperformed the current state-of-the-art architectures on 3 different types of ablations on the UC Merced and Open Cities AI datasets. We have submitted the paper in the **IEEE IGARSS 2022** conference. More info in the [projects section](https://advaitkumar3107.github.io/projects)

I completed a Research and Development Internship with **Philips** (Bangalore) in the summers of 2020, where I applied deep learning in the healthcare domain. I also completed a Software Development Engineering Internship with **Amazon** (Hyderabad) in the summers of 2021, where I helped them develop the CRUD API for the database management of one of the website features.

Apart from this I was a part of the placement team in my 4th year as a **Placement Coordinator**. Our team broke the record for the most students placed in the first phase of placements. I have also been a **Teaching Assistant** for the following courses : 
* MA108 - Differential Equations I
* MA207 - Differential Equations II
* GNR652 - Machine Learning for Remote Sensing I
* GNR638 - MAchine Learning for Remote Sensing II

In my free time you will most certainly find me in either the **Badminton** Courts or the **Tennis** Courts or just catching up on all the **professional wrestling** action that took place in the week prior (AEW > WWE :p).
