I am a 4th year undergraduate student doing an Inter-Disciplinary Dual Degree Program (IDDDP) with a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering and a Master’s in AI & Data Science from IIT Bombay.

I joined IIT Bombay in the dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) programme in Electrical Engineering in the year 2018. 

Working on building an Optical Character Reader (OCR) as part of the Institute Technical Summer Project (ITSP) in the summers of 2019, piqued my interest in the fields of **deep learning** and **computer vision**. We presented this project as part of the Tech Expo 2019 held at IIT Bombay

This was followed by a few more courses as well as projects in this field in my 2nd year. I was also a Teaching Assistant for the course **MA108(Differential Equations - I)**. I completed a **Research Intern** at Philips India (Summer 2020) which was focused on using deep learning for images related to healthcare for disease detection. 

I delved 'deeper' into DL/CV by pursuing a Research and Development project under Prof. Biplab Banerjee in my 3rd year, which has culminated into a submission in the **IEEE IGARSS 2022** conference of our work, *RSINet: Inpainting Remotely Sensed Images Using Triple GAN Framework*. I was also a Teaching Assistant for the courses **MA207 (Differential Equations - II)** and **GNR638 (Machine Learning for Remote Sensing - I)**. 

I completed a **Software Development Internship** with Amazon (Hyderabad) in the summers of 2021 and also received a **Pre-Placement Offer** from them!

In my 4th year, I worked with the Placement team of IIT Bombay as a **Placement Coordinator**. Our team broke the record for the most students placed in the first phase of placements! I was also a Teaching Assistant for the course **GNR652 (Machine Learning for Remote Sensing - II)** and am currently pursuing my Bachelor's thesis under Prof. Biplab Banerjee on the topic *Video Action Recognition using Generalised Zero Shot Learning*.

In my free time you will most certainly find me in either the **Badminton** Courts or the **Tennis** Courts or just catching up on all the professional wrestling action that took place in the week prior (AEW > WWE :p).
