Hello there! I am a 4th year undergraduate student doing an Inter-Disciplinary Dual Degree Program with a Bachelor's in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in) and a Master's in [AI & Data Science](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/) from [IITB](https://www.iitb.ac.in). I am currently working on Video Action Recognition, using Generalised Zero Shot Learning, as part of my Bachelor's thesis under [Prof. Biplab Banerjee](https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/). More information on what I do [here](https://advaitkumar3107.github.io/about).

I love to work on problems in the fields of **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision** and more recently, **Reinforcement Learning**.

Since you are already here, do have a look at my [CV]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/CV.pdf)! (updated January 2022)

Going to be posting blogs soon......
